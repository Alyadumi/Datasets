I dont understand some of the bad reviews. 
this hotel is a steal. 
only a few minute drive from the strip and it was $41 a night on weeknights through expedia. 
my fave thing about the hotel is the free high speed internet in the room. 
very clean, you can park right next to your room, full kitchen, great price. 
also, i got maid service every day. 
i read a couple reviews where they said they didnt get maid service. 
i have no complaints about this hotel.
